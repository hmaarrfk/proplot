Installation
============

This package is a work-in-progress -- currently, there is no formal release
on PyPi (ETA: January 2020). For the time being, you may install directly from Github using:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install git+https://github.com/lukelbd/proplot.git

To upgrade to the latest version, run ``pip uninstall proplot``, then re-install.

The dependencies are `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`__ and `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`__.  The optional geographic mapping features require `cartopy <https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/>`__ and/or `basemap <https://matplotlib.org/basemap/index.html>`__.
